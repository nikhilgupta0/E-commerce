# üéØ Milestone Implementation Summary

This document provides a detailed breakdown of how each milestone has been implemented in the e-commerce application.

## ‚úÖ Milestone 1: Database Design and Loading Data

### Implementation Details:
- **Database Technology**: SQLite with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Design**: 
  - `products` table with comprehensive product fields
  - `departments` table for normalized department management
  - Proper relationships between tables
- **Data Loading Process**:
  - CSV parser (`csv-parser`) to read `products.csv`
  - Data validation and cleaning
  - Batch processing for efficient loading
  - Error handling for malformed data

### Files Created:
- `server/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema definition
- `server/seed.js` - Data loading script
- `server/products-sample.csv` - Sample data structure

### Key Features:
- Automatic department creation from product data
- Data validation (price, stock, rating ranges)
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Comprehensive error handling

## ‚úÖ Milestone 2: REST API for Products

### Implementation Details:
- **Framework**: Express.js with Node.js
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/products` - List products with pagination, search, filtering
  - `GET /api/products/:id` - Get individual product details
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Pagination (page, limit parameters)
  - Search functionality (name, description, category)
  - Department filtering
  - Error handling and validation

### Files Created:
- `server/index.js` - Main Express server
- `server/package.json` - Backend dependencies

### API Examples:
```bash
# Get all products
GET /api/products

# Get products with pagination
GET /api/products?page=1&limit=10

# Search products
GET /api/products?search=wireless

# Filter by department
GET /api/products?department=Electronics

# Get specific product
GET /api/products/1
```

  - Product detail pages
  - Responsive design for all devices
- **Features**:
  - Modern, professional UI design
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Navigation between list and detail views
  - Star ratings display

### Files Created:
- `client/src/components/ProductList.tsx` - Product listing component
- `client/src/components/ProductDetail.tsx` - Product detail component
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` - Application header
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Main application component

## ‚úÖ Milestone 4: Database Refactoring

### Implementation Details:
- **Database Normalization**: Separated departments into their own table
- **Relationships**: Products linked to departments via foreign keys
- **Data Integrity**: Proper constraints and relationships
- **Migration Strategy**: Seamless data migration from flat structure

### Schema Changes:
```sql
-- Before: Flat structure with department as string
products (id, name, description, price, department, ...)

-- After: Normalized structure
products (id, name, description, price, department_id, ...)
departments (id, name, created_at, updated_at)
```

### Benefits:
- Reduced data redundancy
- Better data integrity
- Easier department management
- Improved query performance

## ‚úÖ Milestone 5: Departments API

### Implementation Details:
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/departments` - List all departments with product counts
  - `GET /api/departments/:name` - Get department details with products
- **Features**:
  - Product count aggregation
  - Department-specific product listings
  - RESTful design patterns

### API Examples:
```bash
# Get all departments
GET /api/departments

# Get specific department
GET /api/departments/Electronics
```

### Response Structure:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Electronics",
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Wireless Headphones",
      "price": 89.99,
      ...
    }
  ],
  "_count": {
    "products": 3
  }
}
```
